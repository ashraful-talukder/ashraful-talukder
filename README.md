<p>I would like to introduce myself as a <b>learner</b> and <b>explorer</b>. I like to travel a lot, explore new places and things to learn new stuff. Currently, I'm learning and working with <b>Spring Boot</b>. I've explored several platforms and languages such as Android, Java, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Natural Language Processing, and so on. I've published several papers that you can find on ResearchGate. I'm very much generous to share my knowledge with others and you can connect with me to ask anything through different social sites from the above links.</p>
